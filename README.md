# Advent of code in Rust

Well, this is my first time doing Advent of Code, let alone doing it in Rust. But I'm excited to learn more about the language and hopefully get better at it.

## Running

I do not recommend you copy the exact answer, since it is different for everyone. But if you want to run it, you can do so by first cd'ing into the directory of the day you want to run, and then running `cargo run --bin part1` or `cargo run --bin part2` depending on which part you want to run.

## Progress

- [x] Day 1
- [x] Day 2

## Disclaimer

You are free to use this code as a reference, but mine is probably not the best way to do it. Moreover, try doing it yourself first before looking at my code. It's more fun that way.
