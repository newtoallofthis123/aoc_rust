Well, this is my first time doing Advent of Code, let alone doing it in Rust. But I'm excited to learn more about the language and hopefully get better at it.

## Running

I do not recommend you copy the exact answer, since it is different for everyone. But if you want to run it, you can do so by first cd'ing into the directory of the day you want to run, and then running `cargo run --bin part1` or `cargo run --bin part2` depending on which part you want to run.

## Honesty

The whole point of Advent of Code is to learn and get better at programming. So I will be honest about my progress and how I did it. If I did use a reference or copied the answer, I will say so. There is no point in lying about it.

## Progress

- [x] Day 1
- [x] Day 2
- [x] Day 3
- [x] Day 4
- [ ] Day 5 (I)
- [x] Day 6
- [x] Day 7
- [x] Day 8
- [x] Day 9
- [ ] Day 10
- [x] Day 11

- [x] Day 13
- [x] Day 14
- [x] Day 15
- [x] Day 16
- [x] Day 17
- [x] Day 18

## Was able to solve with reference

These are usually problems for which I was able to solve part 1, but not part 2. So I had to look at the answer to part 2, realize my mistake, and then solve it.

- [x] Day 13 (Part 2)
- [x] Day 16

## Understood and Copied the answer

These are problems that I copied off another answer, but I took the time to understand it and learn from it.

- [x] Day 11 (Part 2)
- [x] Day 14 (Part 2)
- [x] Day 17

## To be reviewed later

These are problems that I was able to solve, but I feel like I could have done better. So I will be reviewing them later.

- [ ] Day 8
- [ ] Day 11
- [ ] Day 14

## Concepts to be learned

- [ ] Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [ ] Min Max Algorithm
- [ ] A* Algorithm

## Disclaimer

You are free to use this code as a reference, but mine is probably not the best way to do it. Moreover, try doing it yourself first before looking at my code. It's more fun that way.
