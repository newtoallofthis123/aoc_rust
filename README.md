# Advent of code in Rust

Well, this is my first time doing Advent of Code, let alone doing it in Rust. But I'm excited to learn more about the language and hopefully get better at it.

## Running

I do not recommend you copy the exact answer, since it is different for everyone. But if you want to run it, you can do so by first cd'ing into the directory of the day you want to run, and then running `cargo run --bin part1` or `cargo run --bin part2` depending on which part you want to run.

## Honesty

The whole point of Advent of Code is to learn and get better at programming. So I will be honest about my progress and how I did it. If I did use a reference or copied the answer, I will say so. There is no point in lying about it.

## What this year is

This year is just me getting my toes wet with AOC and Rust. I'm not going to be too hard on myself if I can't solve a problem. I'm just going to see how other people solved it and learn from them.

## So My actual Stats

Well, since I am actually copying from other solutions when I can't solve it, I will be honest about my stats. I will be using the following system:

- [x] Solved it myself
- [x] Solved it with reference
- [x] Understood and Copied the answer
- [x] To be reviewed later

Well, hopefully I can get better at this.

### My Actual Stars

Even though my AOC profile will show that I have all the stars, my actual stars, the ones that I did myself, are around **20**

## Progress

- [x] Day 1
- [x] Day 2
- [x] Day 3
- [x] Day 4
- [ ] Day 5 (I)
- [x] Day 6
- [x] Day 7
- [x] Day 8
- [x] Day 9
- [ ] Day 10
- [x] Day 11
- [ ] Day 12
- [x] Day 13
- [x] Day 14
- [x] Day 15
- [x] Day 16
- [x] Day 17
- [x] Day 18

## Was able to solve with reference

These are usually problems for which I was able to solve part 1, but not part 2. So I had to look at the answer to part 2, realize my mistake, and then solve it.

- [x] Day 13 (Part 2)
- [x] Day 16

## Understood and Copied the answer

These are problems that I copied off another answer, but I took the time to understand it and learn from it.

- [x] Day 11 (Part 2)
- [x] Day 14 (Part 2)
- [x] Day 17
- [x] Day 19

## To be reviewed later

These are problems that I was able to solve, but I feel like I could have done better. So I will be reviewing them later.

- [ ] Day 8
- [ ] Day 11
- [ ] Day 14

## Concepts to be learned

- [ ] Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [ ] Min Max Algorithm
- [ ] A* Algorithm
- [x] Shoe Lace Algorithm

## Disclaimer

You are free to use this code as a reference, but mine is probably not the best way to do it. Moreover, try doing it yourself first before looking at my code. It's more fun that way.
